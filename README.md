A very simple service to be used as backend for generic web forms

# Why, What, How

With the growing popularity of static sites, users often end up able to do 99% of the work they want, 
and run into a stone wall for the remaining 1%: forms where the user sends data to the site's owner.

Some solutions for this problem already exist, the most popular being [Google Forms](http://forms.google.com), of hosted services
that will provide the user a generic form he can use.

Google Forms, however, has some problems:

1. Styling: They look like google forms
2. Privacy: They are **google** forms

So, I have decided to explore how far I can take the creation of such a service in a lean project:

* Will do the minimum needed
* In an easily extensible manner
* In a limited amount of time

The third item is important: if this project is much more complex than I foresee, I fully intend to kill it with fire
and recommend people use Google forms or alternatives.
